            <p>Hayche embodies the visionary dream of its founder and CEO, Aisha Yusuf. In 2012, she laid the foundation for
                the Hayche Network, initially conceived as a specialized hospitality management and recruitment agency. Our
                primary focus was on training and supplying top-tier industry professionals to the ever-evolving Hospitality
                sector.</p>
            <p>Within three years, the Hayche Network had grown to encompass over eleven thousand members. These ranged from
                highly experienced individuals in the hospitality industry, including general managers, food and beverage
                directors, chefs, and supervisors, to those with no little or no experience. From this diverse talent pool,
                we are able to quickly select and deploy candidates to various roles, thereby fostering an efficient
                recruitment process.</p>

            <p>However, a noticeable disparity emerged, with a significant number of network members lacking any industry
                experience. To address this gap, Aisha Yusuf conceived the Hayche Academy. Its mission is to prepare
                individuals for a rewarding career in the hospitality sector. The synergy between Hayche Academy and The
                Network creates an integrated human resource service, empowering our clients with effective HR management
                solutions.</p>

            <p>By 2016, Hayche had successfully undertaken HR management for a diverse portfolio of hospitality
                establishments throughout Nigeria. In response to this growth, we developed two essential tools: the
                Candidate Evaluation Mobile App (CEMA) and the Human Resource Information System (HaycheR). CEMA
                revolutionized candidate assessment by capturing both quantitative and qualitative data, evaluating
                experience, skills, knowledge, and work styles. Meanwhile, HaycheR became a central hub for employee data,
                payroll management, recruitment processes, benefits administration, and attendance tracking.</p>

            <p>Expanding our digital capabilities, we developed various mobile apps to support our clients in streamlining
                administrative processes, minimizing fraud, and realizing significant productivity gains by reducing the
                overreliance on paper. This led to the establishment of the Hayche Digital business unit, dedicated to the
                development of mobile data solutions.</p>

            <p>In 2017, Hayche successfully secured a contract to conduct organizational capacity assessments (OCA) for
                civil society organizations across Nigeria. This endeavour prompted the development of the Organizational
                Capacity Assessment Mobile App (OCAM) to facilitate the assessment process. Subsequently, Hayche identified
                a prevailing weakness among these organizations in monitoring and evaluation (M&E). To address this, we
                entered into a strategic partnership with Ai Data Management Solutions, enabling us to provide M&E support
                to CSOs and non-profit organizations. This collaboration culminated in the formation of the Hayche
                Development (HDev) business unit, dedicated to supporting non-profits, and government ministries to
                integrate M&E as a management tool, rather than a donor requirement.</p>

            <p>Hayche Lifestyle (HL) is committed to empowering women and girls, promoting wellness and African culture, and
                encouraging professional cultural exchange.</p>

            <p>A major initiative of HL is the Train Tough Smart Safe (TTSS), a violence risk reduction program that teaches
                young girls and women to avoid becoming victims of sexual violence.

            </p>

            <p>TTSS is not merely a program; it's a transformative initiative that empowers women and girls to take charge
                of their own safety and well-being. Through dedicated training and continuous support, TTSS aims to create a
                world where women and girls can confidently face the challenges posed by violence and emerge stronger and
                more resilient.</p>

            <p>Currently available in Abuja and Enugu. TTSS extends an open invitation to trainers interested in expanding
                its reach to other locations. Interested individuals are required to undergo comprehensive training and
                certification. Upon successful completion, certified instructors gain access to the TTSS curriculum and
                receive ongoing support to ensure adherence to program methodology, and approach.</p>

            <p>Our managing director Andrew Igbo, a seasoned martial arts expert developed TTSS in collaboration with
                martial arts instructors, and security experts in various countries. Mr. Igbo has over three decades of
                experience in training and teaching martial arts and self-defense to diverse populations worldwide.</p>
